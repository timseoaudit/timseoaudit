- 👋 Hi, I’m @timseoaudit
- 👀 I’m interested in Chess, Squash, Emergency Medicine and started Coding with Codecademy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS for front-end development. I did learn some Python basics in the past. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner friendly projects to learn and grow. This is all new to me and i am more confused than i like to admit. 
- 📫 How to reach me? I guess best way is to reach me here

  I plan to publish all my Codecademy Projects so I can see my Progress but also can share with other people what I did archive so far.
